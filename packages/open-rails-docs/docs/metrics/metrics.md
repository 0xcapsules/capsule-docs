### Solana:

Okay Bears sold about 7,000 NFTs in about a minute (hard to measure) on April 26 2022. The bot-spam competing for the mint crashed the Solana network at the time, dropping Solana's TPS to below 400.

Cost:

.7 SOL per 100 KBs = $24.50
1 NEAR per 100 KBs = $3.20

Solana NFT

### Ethereum:

Otherside: 55,000 in 3 hours.
5 mints per second

Ethereum is only capable of about 25 transactions per second, so that means it would take about 7 minutes to sell out a 10k collection (at the cost of shutting down the entire Ethereum network).
