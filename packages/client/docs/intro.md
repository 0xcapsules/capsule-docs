# Introduction

OpenRails is an open-source suite of tools for wallet and dapp developers building on Solana. Similar to EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) we collect and debate community-written standards for Solana. As the Solana ecosystem grows, standards will keep projects interoperable and save developers time so we're not reinventing the wheel differently / duplicating work.

Current Areas of focus:

- Wallet <-> Dapp communication and redirect flows
- Authentication standard
- Transaction-construction libraries for merchants
- Transaction verification and observation libraries for merchants
