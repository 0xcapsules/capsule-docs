### Welcome

This is a community-maintained repo that hosts documentation for the noot standard, and any noot improvement proposals.

[Read the docs here](https://openrails.dev/)

Do you have a proposal of your own, or would like to suggest a change to an existing proposal? Could the documentation be expanded somewhere? Is some information incorrect or out of date?

Feel free to [create an issue here](https://github.com/Open-Rails/Docs/issues) or edit / add any documents to the [/docs folder](https://github.com/Open-Rails/Docs/tree/master/packages/open-rails-docs/docs) and then submit a pull-request. Thanks.
