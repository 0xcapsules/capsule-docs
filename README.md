### Welcome

Do you want to help build the next generation of digital asset ownership? Well you're in the right spot!

This is a community-maintained repo that hosts documentation for the noot standard, and all noot improvement proposals.

[Read The Noot-Docs Here](https://www.noots.dev/)

Do you have a noot-improvement-proposal, or would like to suggest a change to an existing proposal? Could the documentation be expanded somewhere? Is some information incorrect or out of date?

Feel free to [create an issue here](https://github.com/open-rails/noot-docs/issues) or edit / add any documents to the [/docs folder](https://github.com/open-rails/noot-docs/tree/master/packages/docusaurus/docs) and then submit a pull-request.
